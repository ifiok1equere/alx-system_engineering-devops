# 0x0C. Web server

This project is where the real deal begins. Here we start buiding the
archithectre needed to serve web pages to client requests.

In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:

- Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
- Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)
